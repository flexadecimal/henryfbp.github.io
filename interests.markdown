## Automotive

I have a long and storied history of buying the same 30 year old Swedish cars. Like your average car guy, I enjoy doing my own maintenance and repairs, at least until a bolt snaps...

## Music
### Listening
I enjoy listening to all sorts of music, but my favorite genres are usually related to these:

* Jazz/R&B (acid jazz, jazz fusion, smooth jazz, etc.)
  - e.g. Casiopea, Grover Washington Jr., Marcus Miller, The Brand New Heavies, Lonnie Liston Smith, etc.
* House (acid house, club, garage, and derivatives)
  - e.g. Kerri Chandler, Daft Punk, labels like Strictly Rhythm
* More elcletic eletronic (drum and bass, jungle, ambient)
  - e.g. Adam F, Goldie, and other assorted artists.
  
### Production
I use [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/), a DAW (digital audio workstation) whose lineage can be traced back to early computing days to the Amiga 500 computer and Protracker (hence the name for the family of programs, "trackers").

_Renoise and its vertical "tracker"-style interface._

It might initially seem like an odd choice considering its unusual vertical scrolling layout, but like most "power tools", it is keyboard heavy and very effective in spite of its high learning curve.
 
### Hi-Fi
I am a big fan of oldschool stereo equipment - seperates like pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, turntables, cassette decks, and related equipment. I have restored turntables and done proper needle adjustment. I currently have a Technics SL-1400, the little brother to the iconic SL-1200, waiting for a good cleaning and new cartridge.
