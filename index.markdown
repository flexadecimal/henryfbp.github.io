Q: Cool site. Can I have one like this?

A: Yes! Clone <http://github.com/HenryFBP/henryFBP.github.io> and just edit it and reupload it to GitHub!

See [this link](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-a-repository-for-your-site) for more info.
