Hello! I'm David Kotaev, welcome to my website. I'm currently a student in Computer Science at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/).

I am first and foremost a programmer - code I have written is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/flexadecimal). I have a particular love for Python, particularly in applications to data processing and data science.

I am also a serial hobbyist - in the blog, you will find posts about electronics (board assembly, wiring harness restoration, etc.), music (listening, production) and all sorts of things I find interesting.
