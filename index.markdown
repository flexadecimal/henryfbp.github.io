This is the website of me, Henry Post, and it has my work experience, personal projects, and general info about me.

I'm a Security Analyst at U.S. Bank, Illinois Institute of Technology alumni, and used to work as a private tutor for Python, Java, and web development.

In my free time I like to bake, go cycling, play video games, and scuba dive (if I have enough time).

Check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/HenryFBP/) for code that I make, and message me if you'd like to get tutored on something or have any questions.
