Librarian/IT Contractor, Oak Bluffs Public Library
July 2018 - August 2018
After working for Oak Bluffs Public Library and replacing many of their old reference computers for a very low cost, I was commissioned by Falmouth Public Library to replicate this for FPL's aging reference computers.

This solution was to use the micro-computer known as the Raspberry Pi as a reference computer and configure it with a restricted desktop environment as well as strict web browsing settings, costing about $40 per unit and saving hundreds of dollars of the costs of buying an entire desktop.

In addition to cost savings, using a custom site blacklist meant absolute control over what sites patrons were allowed to visit (or not visit).

Day-to-day technological operations such as setting up/turning off PCs
Troubleshooting IT issues such as connection, computer operation, and printers.
Answering patrons' questions regarding printing, word processing software, phones, and all other technological questions.
Documenting procedures, protocols, and troubleshooting regarding the custom Raspberry Pi hardware solution.
The reason for this one-month employment is I was only visiting my relatives in Massachusetts, and decided to pick up a summer job. I did not expect to be doing contracting work, but it evolved into that after my IT skills were realized and applied by the library's director and word got around.
