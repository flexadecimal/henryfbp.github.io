## Tutor Bio

I'm an ITM undergrad and work part-time as a tutor for my fellow college students when I'm studying at school, and I love doing it!

As someone who took a lot of useful and intuitive classes, I noticed that being hands-on and giving examples of how to apply concepts to data or situations makes note-taking, remembering things, and solving problems a lot easier. I am very used to explaining everything from abstract concepts to drawing diagrams of code, to actively debugging code with students and stepping through line-by-line to explain the flow of the program and spot any errors.

When teaching somebody a new idea, I give them an example of how that idea can be used in the real world, and will supply numerous demonstrations that the student can replicate themselves! In this way, the taught material is not only easier to remember, but more immediately useful to the student. Programming in any language is by far the most fun subject for me to teach, and I'll never run out of cool examples or projects.

I have three years tutoring most ITM and CS classes for my college, from 1xx courses to 4xx courses. I always use diagrams, give code examples, and make sure that the student is able to use my examples. We use examples to build their own code, using examples that I go over with them as we discuss related concepts.

I have covered, taught, and/or studied:
- file i/o
- recursive functions
- control structures such as while, for, and do loops
- data structures like lists, singly and doubly-linked lists, stacks, queues, hashmaps, and their runtime complexity and implementations
- polymorphism
- inheritance
- digital logic (MUX, DEMUX, AND/NAND/OR/p-type and n-type transistors)
- Arduino circuitry
- C, C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript

Note about lesson recordings: If you request it, I can and will do lesson recordings for you for FREE using OBS Studio, and they will be hosted on Youtube, unlisted. This is to supplement the Wyzant paid lesson recording service.


## Reviews

### Patient, flexible & understanding.
>   I was extremely impressed by Henry. He took the time to prepare for our session & really helped me out a lot. I would heartily recommend him & will definitely use him again.

-   M., 6 lessons with Henry

### Like a fine aged cheese
>   Henry is super knowledgeable with Python. He's always willing to dive into whatever crazy stuff I want to seek out. He doesn't get frustrated when he has to explain things to me, time and time again. He's friendly and supportive and overall cares about your learning experience and not just his payment. He takes feedback well and will adjust on the fly to meet your learning needs. He's always on time to sessions and is understanding of scheduling conflicts. He has many tools at his disposal in his ability to progress your learning, and understands surrounding technologies that increase your overall efficiency in learning coding. I'd recommend Henry to anyone trying to learn Python, I'd even recommend him for a job. He's a good person, and that's difficult to find sometimes.
