## The course

As part of on-the-job training, I got the chance to take a really nice course on UDemy called 
'Ethical Hacking & Bug Hunting: Buffer Overflow For Beginners' by Eslam Medhat.

It uses Kali and Windows VMs that communicate with eachother in order to perform DLL injection that leads to a reverse shell being opened.

## The tools

- Kali VM
    - Metasploit Framework
        - Used for creating payloads like reverse shells
        - pattern_create.rb
            - Used to create a pattern (`Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1` ...) that is 
            unique every 3 bytes to determine where data is injected into a buffer if you are only able to see 3-4 bytes,
            like 32-bit CPU registers 
            - This is useful when attempting to determine exactly when a buffer begins to overflow into the stack. 
        - pattern_offset.rb
            - Used to identify a sub-pattern to a position (i.e. `a1A` would be position 3)
    - NetCat / nc
        - Used to poke simple TCP programs like vulnserver.
    - spike / tcp_send_packet
        - Used to fuzz inputs
- Windows
    - lol todo :)
