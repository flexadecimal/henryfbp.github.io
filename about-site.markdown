Q: Cool site. Can I have one like this?

A: Yes! This site is based on a template provided by Henry Post. Clone <http://github.com/HenryFBP/henryFBP.github.io> and edit to suit your needs!

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) based static site generator.

See [this link](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-a-repository-for-your-site) for more info.
